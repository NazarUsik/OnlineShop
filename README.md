# OnlineShop

#### Develop a server application for an online store selling goods. With the following functionality:
- adding / changing information on the product and on the unit of goods
- API for generating a check for a unit of goods in pdf format (list of goods (product name, -EAN, product price), total purchase amount)
- Integrate swagger2
- registration / login (JWT)
- crud by user
- the ability to recover a password via email (to the context of the task for local testing, use gmail smtp or outlook)
- adding the administrator role (one in the system), the administrator has the ability to ban users
- realize the ability to add / remove media for the product (and add media to the product information response)
- implement the system of profiles in the project (local, dev, stage, prod in the context of the task - you need to refer to one local database but to different schema)
- Adding a connection pool to the database (HikariPool)
- creating executable jar file



### Technology Stack:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- Swagger
- Postgress
